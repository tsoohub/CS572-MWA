1. Explain why do we want sometimes to use setImmediate instead of using setTimeout?
Despite, setImmediately will process a callback to execute at check phase of the event loop after IO events callbacks.

2. Explain the difference between process.nextTick and setImmediate
setImmediate													process.nextTick
1. Add callback at check phase of the event loop.				1. nextTick is not part of event loop, adds the callback into nextTick queue.
2. Run at check phase of event loop.							2. Node processes all the callbacks in queue before event loop.
